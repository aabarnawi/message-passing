# UdaConnect Microsercies Architecture
## Overview

### Design Arch
![alt text](https://github.com/aabarnawi/message-passing/blob/main/docs/architecture_design.png.png?raw=true)

The API has been seperated into connections API and Persons API. <br />
**Persons API :** A microservice that routes on /persons which contains the get, getall and create operation<br />
**Connections API :** this was chosen to be a sperate module since it should have the luxury to scale verticaly and horizontaly, since its the most resource consumable module. Also , a slight modifciation was made to the route to run on the route /connections.<br />
**Location grPC Server & Producer:** this module depends on the location event generator, which in turn will use the stub Create to create the Lcoation event , which then will be produced by the gRPC producer/Server into the kafka cluster<br />
**Location consumer:** This module consume all the locations available in the locatoins topic, and saves it to the database.<br />
**Location Event Generator:** This is a client (found under the Location grPC Server & Producer module ) it is to be used by end users smartphones, smart watches ...etc to trigger the RPC.<br />
**Front End:** This will use the persons api and the connections api seemlessly.<br />

## Running the app
To run the app please follow the sections below.
### Prerequisites
We will be installing the tools that we'll need to use for getting our environment set up properly.
1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
2. [Set up a DockerHub account](https://hub.docker.com/)
3. [Set up `kubectl`](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/cluster-admin/cluster-access/kubectl/)
4. [Install VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) with at least version 6.0
5. [Install Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/installation) with at least version 2.0

### Environment Setup
To run the application, you will need a K8s cluster running locally and to interface with it via `kubectl`. We will be using Vagrant with VirtualBox to run K3s.

#### Initialize K3s
In this project's root, run `vagrant up`.
```bash
$ vagrant up
```
The command will take a while and will leverage VirtualBox to load an [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/) OS and automatically install [K3s](https://k3s.io/). When we are taking a break from development, we can run `vagrant suspend` to conserve some ouf our system's resources and `vagrant resume` when we want to bring our resources back up. Some useful vagrant commands can be found in [this cheatsheet](https://gist.github.com/wpscholar/a49594e2e2b918f4d0c4).

#### Set up `kubectl`
After `vagrant up` is done, you will SSH into the Vagrant environment and retrieve the Kubernetes config file used by `kubectl`. We want to copy the contents of this file into our local environment so that `kubectl` knows how to communicate with the K3s cluster.
```bash
$ vagrant ssh
```
You will now be connected inside of the virtual OS. Run `sudo cat /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml` to print out the contents of the file. You should see output similar to the one that I've shown below. Note that the output below is just for your reference: every configuration is unique and you should _NOT_ copy the output I have below.

Copy the contents from the output issued from your own command into your clipboard -- we will be pasting it somewhere soon!
```bash
$ sudo cat /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml

```
Type `exit` to exit the virtual OS and you will find yourself back in your computer's session. Create the file (or replace if it already exists) `~/.kube/config` and paste the contents of the `k3s.yaml` output here.

Afterwards, you can test that `kubectl` works by running a command like `kubectl describe services`. It should not return any errors.

### Steps

#### Short way : 
you can isntead run `kubectl apply -f deployment/`
to deploy the whole componenets at once.

#### Long way :
1. `kubectl apply -f deployment/db-configmap.yaml` - Set up environment variables for the pods
2. `kubectl apply -f deployment/db-secret.yaml` - Set up secrets for the pods
3. `kubectl apply -f deployment/postgres.yaml` - Set up a Postgres database running PostGIS
4. `kubectl apply -f deployment/udaconnect-connections-api.yaml` - Set up the service and deployment for the Connections API
5. `kubectl apply -f deployment/udaconnect-persons-api.yaml` - Set up the service and deployment for the Persons API
6. `kubectl apply -f deployment/udaconnect-app.yaml` - Set up the service and deployment for the web app
7. `kubectl apply -f deployment/kafka_consumer.yaml` - Set up the service and deployment for kafka producer
8. `kubectl apply -f deployment/kafka_producer.yaml` - Set up the service and deployment for the kakfa consumer residing the the gRPC server
9. `sh scripts/run_db_command.sh <POD_NAME>` - Seed your database against the `postgres` pod. (`kubectl get pods` will give you the `POD_NAME`)

###

Note: The first time you run this project, you will need to seed the database with dummy data. Use the command `sh scripts/run_db_command.sh <POD_NAME>` against the `postgres` pod. (`kubectl get pods` will give you the `POD_NAME`). Subsequent runs of `kubectl apply` for making changes to deployments or services shouldn't require you to seed the database again!

### Verifying it Works
Once the project is up and running, you should be able to see 3 deployments and 3 services in Kubernetes:
`kubectl get pods` and `kubectl get services` - should both return `udaconnect-app`, `udaconnect-connecitons-api`,`udaconnect-persons-api`,`udaconnect-kafka-consumer`,`udaconnect-kafka-producer`, and `postgres`
